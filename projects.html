						<h2>How to stand still in an (centripetally) accelerating train</h2>
						<p>6/10; In Progress</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
				This summer, I am riding the Caltrain to SIMR (more on that later!). Going to SIMR, I ride the northbound train during rush hour, so the train is usually very crowded! I often stand in the middle of the carriage, so there are no supports for me to hold onto (poles, bars, etc.). This is problematic particularly when the train undergoes any curved motion.				</p>
				<p>
				There is a specific part on my journey where the train curves a bit, accelerating towards the east. For about three seconds, there is a noticeable (but currently not quantifiable) acceleration to the west felt by the passengers. This is likely the centrifugal force induced by the accelerating train. 
    </p>
    			<p>
    			I'd like to be able to stand still when this happens and am convinced there is a way supported by classical mechanics.

						<h2>Improving My Research on Dimensionality Reduction for JSM 2019 via Meta-Analayses</h2>
						<p>04/19; In Progress; at Joint Statistical Meetings 2019</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
				This summer, I have the wonderful opportunity of being able to present the research I conducted with Professor Chen to a panel of professionals in the field alongside graduate/doctorate students from very prestigious institutions! Obviously, my work as a high schooler will not be as polished and professional as those of my peers this time, but I want to be able to do the best I can with the research that I have done, regardless of my age/background. 
				
				So, until the conference itself in July, I am doing what I can to elevate my research project. The paper I have published goes over the theory in quite some detail, but only explores one practical application with one particular dataset. I want to extend my analysis to multiple datasets and perhaps that will allow me to present some statistics on my individual statistics (meta-statistics!). 
				
				To collect such data, I will devise a function that takes a dataset as a parameter and runs the necessary calculations. I will draw from a variety of data sources in hopes for a comprehensive image of the techniques in general. 
				
				I will upload my final poster once I finish presenting this July!

						<h2>Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning</h2>

				  <p>
 			 This is a paper I recently published that culminates my work over the recent months. I worked with <a href = 'http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/guangliang.chen/index.html'>Professor Guangliang Chen from SJSU</a>
  					to review what exists in current literature and then test the theory against a data set. Some of the results were really quite surprising!
  
  					I then was fortunate to given a presentation regarding some of my findings to a rather reputable set of people at UC Irvine. I have attached the presentation
 						 slides (wherein I delve deeper into the results, as opposed to scrutinizing the theory), below.

						<h2>Speed Versus Gradient of my Bike Rides</h2>
						<p>10/18; Inspired by Jacob Nie</p>
					</header>
					
					
						  <center><img src="speedgrad.png" style = "width: 600px; height : 500px"></center>

			            <p> Analyzed the speed and gradient of my bike rides with Python and a bit of maths. Converted the gpx files native to Strava into a dataframe of GPS values.
			            I did not have access to Google Earth's API, so speed was estimated mathematically. Because the distance covered in small time intervals subtended a very small
			            angle of the Earth's radius, I simply used the Cartesian distance formula* to estimate such a distance. The differential size of distance also allowed me to assume
			                a constant speed and thus I could approximate speed. Elevation was found using the <a href = "https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio">rasterio</a> package, and I  just subtracted adjacent elevations to find how the elevation changed.   </p>
  
  							<p> The graph shows gradient, which I approximated** as the ratio of elevation and distance, plotted against speed. The orange line is the linear model of the graph, which shows that I go slower on steeper hills (makes sense...). A heatmap is also shown below to explore what types of terrain and speeds I traverse  the most often. </p>
  
  <p> Obviously big residuals, because of measurement inaccuracies and the general engineer-esque methods of my calculations.</p>
  <p> *Maybe I should use spherical coordinates here to be a little more accurate </p>
  <p> **By the Taylor expansion of the (arc)tangent function </p>
