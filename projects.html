						<h2>Presenting SIMR Research (AMIA Conference)</h2>
						<p> 11/19</p>
					</header>
					
					<p>
   				 	I'm really happy to have been invited to present my research at the American Medican Informatics Association Annual Conference in DC! I'm currently writing this on the plane ride there, while I finish up my slides :).
					</p>
					
					 <p>
					Lots of really high-impact, meaningful research projects to be presented here, I'll update with what I find cool once the conference ends! I'll also be uploading my slides for my talk and good pictures I can get. I'm trying to get my presentation recorded in one way or the other, so I can share it with others. 
					<br />
					<br />
					Yeah, this is the same project as the one that I'm publishing soon with my lab from SIMR: I've worked on it for almost half a year now so I'm excited about talking about it and sharing. Especially with this specific project, which we think could be impactful to the research community from a methods standpoint (not limited to results), I want to make it as accessible as possible as soon as possible, and peer-review journals take quite a while.
					<br />
					<br />

					So, we'll see what happens. The hard work is (mostly) done, and there are a lot of great opportunities from here. Looking forward to landing in DC!

						<h2>State Education Bill</h2>
						<p>08/19 - Present; Assemblyman Evan Low</p>
					</header>

					  <p>
					  Through YAPA, I was quite happy to see the growth of my peers, and it excites me that I was able to create a passion for public service. 
					</p> 
					
					  <p>
					The week after YAPA, I started wondering if there was anything else I could do to expand my horizons regarding encouraging public service. <br />

					One thing that I was always aware of was that my high school (and after some research, pretty much all of California) educated only on federal governments and their engagement. YAPA prompted my questioning of this: if the majority of our tangible change occurs locally, why are we fixating on national politics? <br /><br />


					
					Seeing the profound difference the YAPA curriculum had on some of our students, I now want everyone in California to receive some education of this form.<br />

					
					With Assemblyman Evan Low, I'm currently working to submit a bill to the California Assembly that will propose an addition to state curriculum to introduce local governments and their engagement to the students. If this passes, all schools will feature YAPA-esque education in their curricula, which is really exciting.
					
					Once I finalize the bill proposal and submission, I'll share it here. Maybe soon I'll have to campaign on behalf of my bill, but I'll focus on submitting it to the Assembly first.

						<h2>Stanford Institutes of Medical Research (SIMR)</h2>
						<p>06/19 - 08/19</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
					 I spent a good chunk of my summer as part of the SIMR program, working under mentor Abhinav Kaushik as part of the Nadeau Lab. Our project sought to use topology as a solution to graph theory-based representation of gene networks. Instead of describing the technicalities of the project, I'll leave some pictures that go into more details.
					</p> 
					
					  <p>
					 I'm pretty happy with how this program turned out. I get along quite well with my mentor, and we are working to formalize the analysis and publish this work, which I'm very excited about. I'll definitely try to keep posting about the progress on that. 
					</p> 
					
					<p>
					<iframe src="images/SIMRposter.pdf" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
					</p>
					
					I would like to include the code that went behind all of these figures/analysis, but since we are redo-ing a large chunk of the analysis (mostly to make it more mathematically rigorous), I'd be much more content sharing the updated code when we finish the manuscript. 
					
					For example, Pearson's coefficient for network recreation is not the most sophisticated technique and definitely won't be smiled upon by the reviewers. It simply is not rigorous enough, especially when the data is so huge and has many degrees of freedom. Needless to say, I'll have plenty to work on before this paper reaches the level I'd like it to be. 
					
					Regardless, SIMR has given me a world of research opportunities, and I am excited for the future of this project!

						<h2>Young American Policy Advocates (YAPA) Summer Camp</h2>
						<p>7/14/19</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
					 This weekend concludes the first successful year of the YAPA summer program! I had the privilege of working with some very bright individuals to help put this camp together. We had a total of about thirty students chosen from a pool of sixty applicants. Information about the camp itself can be found <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/apapa-san-jose/young-american-policy-advocates">at our site</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					My main role, apart from planning the program, was to design a series of government lectures from the city level going upward. Because YAPA is focused on creating policy, hoping to empower students to submit bills and white papers of their own, it is cruicial they understand how government works. I've included the presentation I created here, which culminates a lot of the things I too have learnt through this experience. It is by no means flawless, and I'd love to hear about ways to improve it.

						<h2>Improving My Research on Dimensionality Reduction for JSM 2019 via Meta-Analayses</h2>
						<p>04/19 - 7/19 at Joint Statistical Meetings 2019</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
				This summer, I have the wonderful opportunity of being able to present the research I conducted with Professor Chen to a panel of professionals in the field alongside graduate/doctorate students from very prestigious institutions! Obviously, my work as a high schooler will not be as polished and professional as those of my peers this time, but I want to be able to do the best I can with the research that I have done, regardless of my age/background. 
				
				So, until the conference itself in July, I am doing what I can to elevate my research project. The paper I have published goes over the theory in quite some detail, but only explores one practical application with one particular dataset. I want to extend my analysis to multiple datasets and perhaps that will allow me to present some statistics on my individual statistics (meta-statistics!). 
				
				To collect such data, I will devise a function that takes a dataset as a parameter and runs the necessary calculations. I will draw from a variety of data sources in hopes for a comprehensive image of the techniques in general. 
				
				I will upload my final poster once I finish presenting this July!

						<h2>Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning</h2>
						<p>8/18 - 1/19; with Professor G. Chen</p>
					</header>
					
					  <p align = "center">

 			 This is a paper I recently published that culminates my work over the recent months. I worked with <a href = 'http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/guangliang.chen/index.html'>Professor Guangliang Chen from SJSU</a>
  					to review what exists in current literature and then test the theory against a data set. Some of the results were really quite surprising!
  
  					I then was fortunate to given a presentation regarding some of my findings to a rather reputable set of people at UC Irvine. I have attached the presentation
 						 slides (wherein I delve deeper into the results, as opposed to scrutinizing the theory), below.
