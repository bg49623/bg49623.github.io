						<h2>Stanford Institutes of Medical Research (SIMR)</h2>
						<p>06/19 - Present</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
					 I spent a good chunk of my summer as part of the SIMR program, working under mentor Abhinav Kaushik as part of the Nadeau Lab. Our project sought to use topology as a solution to graph theory-based representation of gene networks. Instead of describing the technicalities of the project, I'll leave some pictures that go into more details.
					</p> 
					
					  <p>
					 I'm pretty happy with how this program turned out. I get along quite well with my mentor, and we are working to formalize the analysis and publish this work, which I'm very excited about. I'll definitely try to keep posting about the progress on that. 
					</p>

					</p>
					
					I would like to include the code that went behind all of these figures/analysis, but since we are redo-ing a large chunk of the analysis (mostly to make it more mathematically rigorous), I'd be much more content sharing the updated code when we finish the manuscript. 
					
					For example, Pearson's coefficient for network recreation is not the most sophisticated technique and definitely won't be smiled upon by the reviewers. It simply is not rigorous enough, especially when the data is so huge and has many degrees of freedom. Needless to say, I'll have plenty to work on before this paper reaches the level I'd like it to be. 
					
					Regardless, SIMR has given me a world of research opportunities, and I am excited for the future of this project!

						<h2>Young American Policy Advocates (YAPA) Summer Camp</h2>
						<p>7/14/19</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
					 This weekend concludes the first successful year of the YAPA summer program! I had the privilege of working with some very bright individuals to help put this camp together. We had a total of about thirty students chosen from a pool of sixty applicants. Information about the camp itself can be found <a href = "https://yapadvocates.wixsite.com/home">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					My main role, apart from planning the program, was to design a series of government lectures from the city level going upward. Because YAPA is focused on creating policy, hoping to empower students to submit bills and white papers of their own, it is cruicial they understand how government works. I've included the presentation I created here, which culminates a lot of the things I too have learnt through this experience. It is by no means flawless, and I'd love to hear about ways to improve it.

					There are some pretty cool pictures of my lectures/the camp itself and I'd love to share those too, when I get access to them.

						<h2>Improving My Research on Dimensionality Reduction for JSM 2019 via Meta-Analayses</h2>
						<p>04/19; In Progress; at Joint Statistical Meetings 2019</p>
					</header>
					  <p>
				This summer, I have the wonderful opportunity of being able to present the research I conducted with Professor Chen to a panel of professionals in the field alongside graduate/doctorate students from very prestigious institutions! Obviously, my work as a high schooler will not be as polished and professional as those of my peers this time, but I want to be able to do the best I can with the research that I have done, regardless of my age/background. 
				
				So, until the conference itself in July, I am doing what I can to elevate my research project. The paper I have published goes over the theory in quite some detail, but only explores one practical application with one particular dataset. I want to extend my analysis to multiple datasets and perhaps that will allow me to present some statistics on my individual statistics (meta-statistics!). 
				
				To collect such data, I will devise a function that takes a dataset as a parameter and runs the necessary calculations. I will draw from a variety of data sources in hopes for a comprehensive image of the techniques in general. 
				
				I will upload my final poster once I finish presenting this July!

						<h2>Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning</h2>

 			 This is a paper I recently published that culminates my work over the recent months. I worked with <a href = 'http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/guangliang.chen/index.html'>Professor Guangliang Chen from SJSU</a>
  					to review what exists in current literature and then test the theory against a data set. Some of the results were really quite surprising!
  
  					I then was fortunate to given a presentation regarding some of my findings to a rather reputable set of people at UC Irvine. I have attached the presentation
 						 slides (wherein I delve deeper into the results, as opposed to scrutinizing the theory), below.

						<h2>Speed Versus Gradient of my Bike Rides</h2>
						<p>10/18; Inspired by Jacob Nie</p>
					</header>
					
					
						  <center><img src="images/speedgrad.png" style = "width: 600px; height : 500px"></center>

			            <p> Analyzed the speed and gradient of my bike rides with Python and a bit of maths. Converted the gpx files native to Strava into a dataframe of GPS values.
			            I did not have access to Google Earth's API, so speed was estimated mathematically. Because the distance covered in small time intervals subtended a very small
			            angle of the Earth's radius, I simply used the Cartesian distance formula* to estimate such a distance. The differential size of distance also allowed me to assume
			                a constant speed and thus I could approximate speed. Elevation was found using the <a href = "https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio">rasterio</a> package, and I  just subtracted adjacent elevations to find how the elevation changed.   </p>
  
  							<p> The graph shows gradient, which I approximated** as the ratio of elevation and distance, plotted against speed. The orange line is the linear model of the graph, which shows that I go slower on steeper hills (makes sense...). A heatmap is also shown below to explore what types of terrain and speeds I traverse  the most often. </p>
  
  <p> Obviously big residuals, because of measurement inaccuracies and the general engineer-esque methods of my calculations.</p>
  <p> *Maybe I should use spherical coordinates here to be a little more accurate </p>
  <p> **By the Taylor expansion of the (arc)tangent function </p>
