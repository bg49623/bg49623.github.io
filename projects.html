  While studying for the USAPhO exam, I came across entropy as an area of study in thermodynamics. There are two "types" of entropy, one which observes the macroscopic states of
    a certain gas (pressure, temperature, etc.), and another that treats the gas at the microscopic level. Because it is very difficult
    to model each individual atom and molecule of a gas, a statistical model has been developed, which uses probability as a treatment for the concept of entropy.

    I was particularly excited to see something I really liked (discrete math!) being applied to something I sort of liked (physics is fun, but thermodynamics...), so I decided to delve 
    a little deeper than what was simply presented with the textbook by posing some questions that I could tackle with programming, statistics, and physics.

  <p>
    It may be worthwhile, for the sake of strong conceptual understanding of both me and my reader, to present the classical theory of statistical entropy.

  This is a paper I recently published that culminates my work over the recent months. I worked with <a href = 'http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/guangliang.chen/index.html'>Professor Guangliang Chen from SJSU</a>
  to review what exists in current literature and then test the theory against a data set. Some of the results were really quite surprising!
  
  I then was fortunate to given a presentation regarding some of my findings to a rather reputable set of people. I have attached the presentation
  slides (wherein I delve deeper into the results, as opposed to scrutinizing the theory), below.

  <h3 align = "center"> Speed versus Gradient of My Bike Rides (10/2018) </h3>
  <h4 align = "center"> Project inspired by Jacob Nie </h4>
  
  <center><img src="speedgrad.png" style = "width: 600px; height : 500px"></center>
  
  <p> Analyzed the speed and gradient of my bike rides with Python and a bit of maths. Converted the gpx files native to Strava into a dataframe of GPS values.
    I did not have access to Google Earth's API, so speed was estimated mathematically. Because the distance covered in small time intervals subtended a very small
    angle of the Earth's radius, I simply used the Cartesian distance formula* to estimate such a distance. The differential size of distance also allowed me assume
    a constant speed and thus I could approximate speed. Elevation was found using the <a href = "https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio">rasterio</a> package, and I 
    just subtracted adjacent elevations to find how the elevation changed. 
  </p>
  
  <p> The graph shows gradient, which I approximated** as the ratio of elevation and distance, plotted against speed. The orange line is the linear
    model of the graph, which shows that I go slower on steeper hills (makes sense...). A heatmap is also shown below to explore what types of terrain and speeds I traverse
    the most often. </p>
  
  <p> Obviously big residuals, because of measurement inaccuracies and the general engineer-esque methods of my calculations.</p>
  <p> *Maybe I should use spherical coordinates here to be a little more accurate </p>
  <p> **By the Taylor expansion of the (arc)tangent function </p>
