					<p>I am a goalkeeper. I would love to play soccer in college, so hopefully someone in that area stumbles upon this page. This page, to some extent, is my
  "recruiting website," wherein I compile some of my highlights as a goalkeeper as well as some general soccer-related information about me (hidden by the buttons for brevity).</p>

<h3 align = "center"> Background </h3>

	<div id = "sectiontohide1" hidden> <p> I have been playing soccer as a goalkeeper for close to 10 years now. For the majority of this decade, I have played club soccer with De Anza Force. 
    Throughout middle school, I developed greatly through the program's rigorous goalkeeper training, both via clinics and integration with the team.
    When I entered high school, I began to take the sport more seriously, and tried out for the Force I team, which played in Premier at the time. I was very fortunate
    to be accepted on the team and train with the team as well as the Force Academy. Through such training, I have played with and against some of the most talented
    soccer players I know, empowering me to become a much better goalkeeper. </p>
  
  <p> I also play school soccer for my high school, Monta Vista. During my freshman year, I was the goalie for the Junior Varsity team. The next year, I played as a backup 
    for the varsity team, under one of the senior goalkeepers. As a junior, I am currently the starting keeper for the team, with a save rate of 0.8 and a shutout rate of 0.5.</p>
  
  <p> Outside of league play, my past teams have rarely attended tournaments (Surf, Showcase, and the like); this is definitely an experience I am excited to have given my participation in soccer during college. </p> </div>

<h3 align = "center"> Values/Philosophies </h3>
  <center><button onclick = "toggle_div_fun('sectiontohide2');"> Click here to view 'Values/Philosophies' </button>
	<div id = "sectiontohide2" hidden> <p> I don't claim to be all-knowing when it comes to goalkeeping, neither do I ever think of myself as the \(N\)th best goalkeeper in some domain. Goalkeeping is interesting for its volatile nature; how "good" a keeper appears is ultimately
    quite circumstantial, and I hesitate to make such associated judgments. What I do think is notable, however, is my general approach to the position.</p>
  <p> My vision of the keeper position derives from the "field player first, keeper second" mentality. Goalkeeping is uncannily like playing fullback with the extra privilege of the hands. A fullback throughout a game will receive many passes from 
    their forwards, mids, etc. I like to encourage the team to treat me similarly as means of achieving depth. Similarly, that means attacking through balls played by the opponent, even if it demands the feet. I like to think of the ability to use hands
    as a privilege and push myself to make the most out of such privilege. </p>
  <p> I love to challenge myself by playing possession/passing games with the rest of my team, as it builds the proper technique that I believe is essential to the position itself. Perhaps evidence of such a mentality manifests itself in media.</p> </div></center>
  
<h3 align = "center"> Media </h3>
  <p> Unfortunately, I only have media from my current season of school soccer.
  Some of these clips in here might be from my training, mostly in response to how short the scholastic season is. </p>
