I am a goalkeeper. This page has certain highlights that I have regarding my soccer experience. Our school has purchased Hudl, software that 
  allows me to easily share excerpts of my play, so credit to them for the recording and software.
  
I would love to play soccer in college, so hopefully someone in that area stumbles upon this page.
