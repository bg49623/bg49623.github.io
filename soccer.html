<h2 align = "center"> Soccer </h2>

  
<p>I am a goalkeeper. I would love to play soccer in college, so hopefully someone in that area stumbles upon this page. This page, to some extent, is my
  "recruiting website," wherein I compile some of my highlights as a goalkeeper as well as some general soccer-related information about me.</p>
  
<h3 align = "center"> Background </h3>
  
  <p> I have been playing soccer as a goalkeeper for close to 10 years now. For the majority of this decade, I have played club soccer with De Anza Force. 
    Throughout middle school, I developed greatly through the program's rigorous goalkeeper training, both via clinics and integration with the team.
    When I entered high school, I began to take the sport more seriously, and tried out for the Force I team, which played in Premier at the time. I was very fortunate
    to be accepted on the team and train with the team as well as the Force Academy. Through such training, I have played with and against some of the most talented
    soccer players I know, empowering me to become a much better goalkeeper. </p>
  
  <p> I also play school soccer for my high school, Monta Vista. During my freshman year, I was the goalie for the Junior Varsity team. The next year, I played as a backup 
    for the varsity team, under one of the senior goalkeepers. As a junior, I am currently the starting keeper for the team, with a save rate of 0.8 and a shutout rate of 0.5.</p>
  
  <p> Outside of league play, my past teams have rarely attended tournaments (Surf, Showcase, and the like); this is definitely an experience I am excited to experience given my participation in soccer during college. </p>
    

<h3 align = "center"> Media </h3>
  <p> Unfortunately, I only have media from my current season of school soccer, as our coached purchased Hudl. Unfortunately, I cannot download these clips until the end of the season,
    but they are embedded in the website design here. Credit to Hudl for compiling these clips, and hopefully I can combine these clips into some aggregate video, or something. </p>
